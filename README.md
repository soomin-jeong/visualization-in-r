# Happiness Dashboard
This project creates an interactive visualization tool for the world happiness dataset. There are multiple ways to run and open the visualization dashboard created by this project.

The first option is to follow the link http://tomknip.shinyapps.io/HappinessDashboard to access the publicated application in shinnyapps.io. It is only required to open a web browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and the Spatial plot will be opened allowing the user to see and interact with the application described above. 

The second option is to execute the code using the RStudio IDE. For this purpose the following steps need to be followed: 

1. Ensure that R and RStudio are installed on the machine where the tool needs to run. R can be downloaded from the official page of The R Project for Statistical Computing: R and RStudio can also be downloaded from its official page. 
2. Download the code from the project’s official Github repository towards the link soomin-jeong/visualization-in-r. The code will be downloaded as a zip file. 
3. Extract the zip file and open the file “app.R” with RStudio. 
4. Run the app.R file in the right corner of RStudio in the button “Run App”
